# Owlscript

Owlscript is a general purpose multi-paradigm programming language
with a focus of blending functional, procedural, and object oriented
programming. Supporting First class functions, lexical scoping, garbage collection,
user defined structs, lambda functions, dynamic lists, and much more.

Running on the Glaux VM, programmers can write code interactively via the REPL
or run saved programs from disk. The `scripts` folder contains implementations 
of classic algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and red black trees.
